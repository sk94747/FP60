## FP Dataset Introduction

According to the distribution of forestry pests in Jiangsu Province, China, we select 15 families and 60 species as shown in Table, which are common and easy to access. We mainly collect forestry pest images from the Internet. During collection, we take the Latin scientific name of each forestry pest as a query keyword and then search in the common image search engines, including Google, Bing, and Baidu. The searched results are manually screened to filter low-quality images. Totally, we have 7253 high-quality forestry pest images with various sizes from 93×140 to 6016×4106. The figure shows images of 60 species forestry pests from this dataset, and each picture represents a species of forestry pest.
<!-- The detail information on this dataset is listed in Table \ref{Table1}, where the names of families and species are Latin. The number of forestry pests in species varies between 72 to 236.
