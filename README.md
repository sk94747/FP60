## FP Dataset Introduction

We used the Internet as the main source for collecting images, using the Latin scientific name of each insect as a query keyword to search in common image search engines including Google, Bing, and Baidu. The results obtained from the search were collected and manually screened to collect a total of 7253 high-quality images of forestry pests in 60 categories, and all images were labeled and classified, and the dataset was divided into three datasets, FP15, FP40, and FP60, by biological family classification, in which FP15 contains 15 species of forestry pests in 10 different biological families, FP40 contains 40 species of forestry pests in 10 different FP15 contains 15 forestry pests in 10 different biological families, FP40 contains 40 forestry pests in 10 different biological families, FP60 contains 60 forestry pests in 15 different biological families, and the datasets are divided into 70% training set, 15% validation set and 15% test set.
